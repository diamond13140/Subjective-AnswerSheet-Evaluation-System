Question: Explain the process of photosynthesis?
Answer: Photosynthesis involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, occurring in
chloroplasts. Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, leading to the synthesis of glucose and oxygen from
carbon dioxide and water.

Question: Describe the concept of gravitational force?
Answer: Gravitational force is the attraction between masses, governed by Newton's law. It
affects all objects universally, with force proportional to masses and inversely proportional to
distance.

Question: What is the structure and function of DNA?
Answer: DNA is a double-helix structure with nucleotides, carrying genetic information.
Transcription and translation processes use DNA as a blueprint for protein synthesis.

Question: Explain the greenhouse effect?
Answer: The greenhouse effect is a natural process where specific gases trap and radiate heat in
Earth's atmosphere. Solar radiation warms the surface, and greenhouse gases retain heat,
sustaining a suitable temperature.

Question: Discuss the properties and uses of magnetic fields?
Answer: Magnetic fields surround magnets, exerting forces. They find applications in motors,
generators, MRI machines, and compasses.

Question: Elaborate on the process of cellular respiration?
Answer: Cellular respiration breaks down glucose in cells, producing energy. It involves glycolysis,
the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria.

Question: Describe the Doppler effect and its applications?
Answer: The Doppler effect is a frequency change in waves due to relative motion. Applications
include weather radar, medical ultrasound, and astronomy.

Question: Explain the principles behind Archimedes' buoyancy?
Answer: Archimedes' principle states objects in a fluid experience an upward buoyant force equal
to the fluid displaced. It explains floating and sinking.

Question: Discuss the stages of the water cycle?
Answer: The water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. Water
transitions between states, contributing to Earth's water balance.

Question: Elaborate on the structure and function of a neuron?
Answer: Neurons, comprising a cell body, dendrites, and axon, transmit signals. Electrical impulses
and neurotransmitters facilitate communication, impacting processes like sensation and
movement.
