Question: Explain the process of photosynthesis?
Answer: The water cycle, or hydrological cycle, consists of several stages. Evaporation occurs when
surface water transforms into vapor due to heat. Condensation results in cloud formation as water
vapor cools and condenses into liquid. Precipitation transpires when water droplets or ice crystals
fall from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Runoff entails the surface flow of water back into
oceans, rivers, or lakes.

Question: Describe the concept of gravitational force?
Answer: Neurons serve as the fundamental units of the nervous system, comprising a cell body,
dendrites, and an axon. Dendrites receive signals, the cell body processes information, and the
axon transmits signals to other neurons or muscles. Neurons communicate through electrical
impulses and neurotransmitters. This structure enables rapid information transmission, playing a
pivotal role in processes such as sensation, movement, and cognition.

Question: What is the structure and function of DNA?
Answer: Magnetic fields are zones around a magnet where magnetic forces operate. They possess
north and south poles, and similar poles repel while opposite poles attract. Magnetic fields are
used in various applications, including electric motors, generators, MRI machines, and magnetic
compasses.

Question: Explain the greenhouse effect?
Answer: Gravitational force is the attractive force between two masses, described by Newton's
law of universal gravitation. This law states that every mass attracts every other mass in the
universe with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the
square of the distance between them.

Question: Discuss the properties and uses of magnetic fields?
Answer: The Doppler effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an
observer moving relative to the source of the wave. In sound, this effect causes a shift in pitch.
Applications include Doppler radar for weather monitoring, medical ultrasound imaging, and
determining the motion of stars in astronomy.

Question: Elaborate on the process of cellular respiration?
Answer: Archimedes' principle states that an object submerged in a fluid experiences an upward
buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. This principle explains why objects float
or sink in fluids and holds significance in ship and submarine design and understanding object
behavior in water.

Question: Describe the Doppler effect and its applications?
Answer: The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon where specific gases in Earth's
atmosphere trap and emit heat. Solar radiation penetrates the atmosphere, heating the Earth's
surface. The surface then emits infrared radiation, but greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and
methane, absorb and re-emit this radiation, preserving heat for a life-sustaining temperature.

Question: Explain the principles behind Archimedes' buoyancy?
Answer: Photosynthesis is the biological mechanism wherein plants, algae, and certain bacteria
convert light energy into chemical energy. Chlorophyll within chloroplasts absorbs sunlight,
initiating reactions that transform carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process
not only generates sustenance for the plant but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere.

Question: Discuss the stages of the water cycle?
Answer: Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down glucose to produce energy
(ATP). It consists of three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative
phosphorylation. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, producing pyruvate. The citric acid cycle takes
place in the mitochondria, generating NADH and FADH2. Oxidative phosphorylation, also in the
mitochondria, involves the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis.

Question: Elaborate on the structure and function of a neuron?
Answer: The greenhouse effect is a natural process where specific gases in Earth's atmosphere
trap and radiate heat. Solar radiation passes through the atmosphere and heats the Earth's
surface. The surface then emits infrared radiation, but greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide
and methane) absorb and re-emit this radiation, trapping heat and maintaining a temperature
suitable for life.
