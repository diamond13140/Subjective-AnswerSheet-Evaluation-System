Question: Explain the process of photosynthesis?

Answer: Photosynthesis is the biological mechanism wherein plants, algae, and certain bacteria
convert light energy into chemical energy. Chlorophyll within chloroplasts absorbs sunlight,
initiating reactions that transform carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process
not only generates sustenance for the plant but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere.

Question: Describe the concept of gravitational force?

Answer: Gravitational force is the attractive force between two masses, defined by Newton's
universal law of gravitation. This law asserts that every mass in the universe attracts every other
mass, with force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the
distance between them.

Question: What is the structure and function of DNA?

Answer: DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a double-helix structure comprised of nucleotides, each
containing a sugar, phosphate group, and nitrogenous base. DNA carries genetic information and
acts as a blueprint for protein synthesis through transcription and translation.

Question: Explain the greenhouse effect?

Answer: The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon where specific gases in Earth's
atmosphere trap and emit heat. Solar radiation penetrates the atmosphere, heating the Earth's
surface. The surface then emits infrared radiation, but greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and
methane, absorb and re-emit this radiation, preserving heat for a life-sustaining temperature.

Question: Discuss the properties and uses of magnetic fields?

Answer: Magnetic fields are zones around a magnet where magnetic forces operate. They possess
north and south poles, and similar poles repel while opposite poles attract. Magnetic fields find
applications in various technologies, including electric motors, generators, MRI machines, and
magnetic compasses.

Question: Elaborate on the process of cellular respiration?

Answer: Cellular respiration is the mechanism through which cells break down glucose to produce
energy (ATP). It encompasses three primary stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative
phosphorylation. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, yielding pyruvate. The citric acid cycle, taking
place in mitochondria, generates NADH and FADH2. Oxidative phosphorylation involves the
mitochondria, encompassing the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis.

Question: Describe the Doppler effect and its applications?

Answer: The Doppler effect denotes the alteration in frequency or wavelength of a wave
concerning an observer moving relative to the wave source. In sound, this effect induces a pitch
shift. Applications include Doppler radar for weather monitoring, medical ultrasound imaging, and
determining stellar motion in astronomy.

Question: Explain the principles behind Archimedes' buoyancy?

Answer: Archimedes' principle stipulates that a submerged object in a fluid encounters an upward
buoyant force equal to the fluid it displaces' weight. This principle clarifies why objects float or
sink in fluids and holds significance in ship and submarine design and understanding object
behavior in water.

Question: Discuss the stages of the water cycle?

Answer: The water cycle, or hydrological cycle, encompasses several phases. Evaporation occurs
when surface water transforms into vapor due to heat. Condensation results in cloud formation as
water vapor cools and condenses into liquid. Precipitation transpires when water droplets or ice
crystals fall from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Runoff entails the surface flow of water back
into oceans, rivers, or lakes.

Question: Elaborate on the structure and function of a neuron?

Answer: Neurons serve as the fundamental units of the nervous system, comprising a cell body,
dendrites, and an axon. Dendrites receive signals, the cell body processes information, and the
axon transmits signals to other neurons or muscles. Neurons communicate through electrical
impulses and neurotransmitters. This structure enables rapid information transmission, playing a
pivotal role in processes such as sensation, movement, and cognition..
